# Self-Hosted iOS Closed-Beta Operations

Start at the [self-hosted mobile documentation index](SELF_HOSTED_DOCUMENTATION.md)
for document ownership and current release state. This runbook is for the
operator. Send testers the separate
[Android and iOS onboarding guide](SELF_HOSTED_TESTER_ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md),
which contains no operator-only values.

This is the operator runbook for distributing the configurable Ente Photos iOS
application to the private `trusted-ios-testers` group through Firebase App
Distribution and Apple Ad Hoc provisioning. It covers release preparation,
publication, device authorization, tester access, updates, removal, and
recovery. For toolchain and signing setup, use the
[mobile build guide](SELF_HOSTED_BUILD_GUIDE.md).

The workflow distributes only the iOS bundle
`me.vanton.ente.photos.selfhosted`. It does not add a Firebase runtime SDK,
publish through TestFlight or the App Store, expose the private server to the
internet, or distribute the Android application.

**Verified baseline (2026-07-20):** marketing version `1.3.59`; Firebase iOS
build `2161`; owner installation, sign-in, upload/download, update, and
persistence accepted. A real second iPhone or iPad has not been available, so
non-owner iOS installation remains unverified. Do not authorize or build from
an identifier collected without that real device; complete section 4 from the
beginning when a tester device is available. Every later iOS publication must
use a strictly higher `CFBundleVersion`.

## 1. Trust boundaries and safety rules

Five independent systems grant different kinds of access:

| System | Grants | Does not grant |
|---|---|---|
| Firebase App Distribution | Invitation, device-registration flow, IPA delivery, and update notifications | Apple device authorization, Tailscale connectivity, or a Museum account |
| Apple Developer Program | App ID, signing certificate, registered devices, and installable Ad Hoc profile | Firebase release access, private network access, or Museum authentication |
| iOS Developer Mode | Permission to launch an Ad Hoc application on iOS 16 or later | Device inclusion in the profile or access to any service |
| Tailscale | Private network access to Museum and object storage | Firebase delivery, Apple authorization, or Museum authentication |
| Museum | An individual encrypted-data account and server session | IPA delivery, Apple device authorization, or private network routing |

Onboard and offboard each tester in every applicable system. Removing a tester
from Firebase does not uninstall an IPA. Excluding a device from a future Ad
Hoc profile does not revoke an already installed build. Removing only
Tailscale access does not remove the Firebase invitation or Museum account.

Always follow these rules:

- Keep tester email addresses, Apple Team IDs, device names and identifiers,
  provisioning profiles, certificate private keys, Firebase or Tailscale invite
  links, access tokens, server credentials, account recovery material, and
  signing inputs out of Git, release notes, public issue trackers, and
  repository screenshots.
- Treat Firebase registration profiles, exported Apple device lists, and Ad Hoc
  provisioning profiles as private because they carry device identifiers.
- Give every person their own Google, Tailscale, and Museum identity. Do not
  share the owner's accounts.
- Never run `firebase login:list --json`; a Firebase CLI version used during
  provisioning printed reusable OAuth material through that command. Verify
  access with a harmless resource query instead.
- Never publish from a dirty or unpushed source commit. Never edit, replace,
  rename, or make a prepared IPA or manifest writable.
- Do not use Firebase's temporary binary-download URL as a durable archive. It
  expires, while the local prepared IPA, manifest, and publication receipt are
  the release evidence.
- Do not use this invitation-only Ad Hoc workflow as public distribution. Every
  receiving iPhone must be registered with Apple and included in the embedded
  provisioning profile.

## 2. Private operator inputs

Set these values locally. The examples are placeholders, not configuration to
commit:

```sh
export ENTE_SELF_HOSTED_ENDPOINT="https://museum-host.tailnet-name.ts.net"
export ENTE_OBJECT_STORAGE_HEALTH_URL="https://museum-host.tailnet-name.ts.net:8443/minio/health/live"
export ENTE_SERVER_DIR="/absolute/path/to/private/quickstart"

export FIREBASE_CLI="/absolute/path/to/firebase"
export ENTE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your-firebase-project-id"
export ENTE_FIREBASE_IOS_APP_ID="your-firebase-ios-app-id"

export ENTE_IOS_DISTRIBUTION_TEAM="YOURTEAMID"
export ENTE_IOS_ADHOC_PROFILE="/absolute/private/path/Ente_Photos_SelfHosted_Ad_Hoc.mobileprovision"
export ENTE_IOS_EXPECTED_DEVICE_COUNT="1"
export ENTE_IOS_MARKETING_VERSION="1.0.0"
export ENTE_IOS_BUILD_NUMBER="1"

export ENTE_IOS_RELEASE_OUTPUT_DIR="/absolute/path/to/prepared-ios-releases"
export ENTE_FIREBASE_RELEASE_RECEIPT_DIR="/absolute/path/to/firebase-ios-receipts"
```

The server directory, profile, release directories, Firebase credentials, and
Apple values stay outside this repository. The Firebase project and App ID are
not secrets, but keeping them local prevents the public fork from becoming
operationally bound to one Firebase project.

Protect any reusable local environment file and its parent directory:

```sh
chmod 700 "/absolute/path/to/private-config-directory"
chmod 600 "/absolute/path/to/private-config-directory/distribution.env"
```

Confirm the CLI can see the intended project without printing authentication
state:

```sh
"$FIREBASE_CLI" projects:list
"$FIREBASE_CLI" appdistribution:groups:list \
  --project "$ENTE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID"
```

The second command must show the stable alias `trusted-ios-testers`.

## 3. Prepare and publish one release

### 3.1 Check the server before building

Do not publish an application update to compensate for a server outage. From
the private quickstart directory, confirm the containers are running:

```sh
cd "$ENTE_SERVER_DIR"
docker compose ps
```

From a Tailscale-connected client, verify Museum's public health contract:

```sh
curl --fail --silent --show-error "$ENTE_SELF_HOSTED_ENDPOINT/ping"
```

The response must be successful JSON whose `message` is `pong`. Verify the
object-storage route separately because Museum returns signed upload and
download URLs for that origin:

```sh
curl --fail --silent --show-error "$ENTE_OBJECT_STORAGE_HEALTH_URL"
```

Also confirm the HTTPS certificate is trusted and the private hostname resolves
from the target network. A reachable Tailscale address with an HTTP `502` from
`/ping` points to the server or proxy layer, not an application build.

### 3.2 Confirm Apple signing and device scope

Before preparing a release, confirm in Apple **Certificates, Identifiers &
Profiles** that:

- the explicit App ID is `me.vanton.ente.photos.selfhosted`;
- the intended Apple Distribution certificate remains active and its private
  key is available in the local login Keychain;
- every intended iPhone or iPad is enabled in **Devices**;
- the manual Ad Hoc profile names the exact App ID, intended distribution
  certificate, and only the currently authorized devices; and
- the profile and certificate will remain valid for the acceptance window.

Set `ENTE_IOS_EXPECTED_DEVICE_COUNT` to the exact number of devices in the
downloaded profile. Do not record their identifiers in a shell transcript or
repository file. The guarded preparation command independently decodes and
checks the profile before building.

### 3.3 Prepare the immutable release

From `mobile/apps/photos`, confirm the intended source is committed, pushed to
the fork, and reachable through `origin`:

```sh
git status --short
git branch -r --contains HEAD
```

The first command must print nothing. The second must include an `origin/*`
reference. Confirm all private inputs in section 2, choose a build number higher
than every prior guarded iOS publication, then run:

```sh
./scripts/prepare_self_hosted_ios_release.sh \
  --output-dir "$ENTE_IOS_RELEASE_OUTPUT_DIR"
```

Copy the exact manifest path printed by the command. Do not select a manifest
through a `latest` symlink or wildcard:

```sh
export ENTE_IOS_RELEASE_MANIFEST="/absolute/path/to/the-printed-release.manifest.json"
```

Review the adjacent read-only IPA and JSON manifest. Confirm at least:

- bundle `me.vanton.ente.photos.selfhosted`;
- intended marketing version and increasing `CFBundleVersion`;
- intended compiled HTTPS Museum origin;
- source commit and public fork commit URL;
- expected Apple team, authorized-device count, certificate fingerprint and
  profile validity without exposing their private values;
- no application extension, debug entitlement, application group, push,
  associated-domain, or iCloud entitlement;
- arm64 application binaries; and
- IPA SHA-256 and read-only paths outside Git.

### 3.4 Run the non-mutating publication preflight

```sh
./scripts/publish_self_hosted_ios_release.sh \
  --manifest "$ENTE_IOS_RELEASE_MANIFEST" \
  --receipt-dir "$ENTE_FIREBASE_RELEASE_RECEIPT_DIR" \
  --firebase-project "$ENTE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID" \
  --firebase-app "$ENTE_FIREBASE_IOS_APP_ID" \
  --preflight-only
```

The command must end with `Preflight passed. No Firebase upload was performed.`
It re-audits the exact IPA, checks prior guarded receipts for a non-increasing
build number, and verifies the active Firebase iOS bundle and
`trusted-ios-testers` group.

### 3.5 Add or review testers

Prefer the Firebase console's **App Distribution > Testers & Groups** page when
handling human identities. Add the intended people to `trusted-ios-testers` and
verify the group contains no unexpected identities. Do not put the list in a
repository file.

The equivalent CLI command is available when appropriate for the operator's
private shell:

```sh
"$FIREBASE_CLI" appdistribution:testers:add "<tester-email>" \
  --group-alias trusted-ios-testers \
  --project "$ENTE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID"
```

A new tester cannot install the current Ad Hoc IPA until their iPhone is
registered with Firebase and Apple and a later IPA embeds a refreshed profile.
Use section 4 for that onboarding loop.

### 3.6 Publish the audited bytes

Optional operator-visible notes belong in a local text file. Do not include
secrets, tester identities, device details, private invitation links, or
recovery material. The command generates the version, IPA hash, exact AGPL
source commit, and commit-pinned build-instructions link automatically.

Run the same command without `--preflight-only`:

```sh
./scripts/publish_self_hosted_ios_release.sh \
  --manifest "$ENTE_IOS_RELEASE_MANIFEST" \
  --receipt-dir "$ENTE_FIREBASE_RELEASE_RECEIPT_DIR" \
  --firebase-project "$ENTE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID" \
  --firebase-app "$ENTE_FIREBASE_IOS_APP_ID"
```

Review every summary field. Type the displayed `PUBLISH <release-id>` value
exactly only when the IPA, source, server, Apple scope, Firebase app, and group
are correct. The command rechecks the files, receipt ledger, native IPA, and
Firebase registration after confirmation; uploads the unchanged IPA once; and
writes a read-only `<release-id>.firebase-ios-release.json` receipt outside
Git.

### 3.7 Reconcile Firebase and the receipt

After success:

1. Open the receipt's Firebase console URL and confirm the displayed marketing
   version, build number, release notes, and `trusted-ios-testers`
   distribution.
2. Confirm the release notes contain the exact public source commit URL.
3. Confirm the receipt's IPA SHA-256 matches the prepared manifest.
4. Confirm Firebase shows the intended testers as invited or accepted; later,
   confirm device-registration and download state for acceptance tests.
5. Preserve the prepared IPA, manifest, and receipt together outside Git.

If the command writes `.firebase-ios-attempt-*.json`, Firebase may have
accepted the binary before a later step failed. Inspect the attempt record and
Firebase console before any retry. Do not assume a nonzero exit or missing CLI
reference means no mutation.

For an exit-`0` JSON-only success, save a private mode-`0444` response from the
official read-only App Distribution release-list API. Set
`ENTE_FIREBASE_IOS_ATTEMPT` and `ENTE_FIREBASE_IOS_RELEASE_EVIDENCE` to the
absolute attempt/evidence paths, run the publisher with `--preflight-only`,
then run it once without that flag. This reconciliation path requires one
exact app/version/build/notes/timestamp/reference match, preserves both input
records, performs no Firebase mutation, and writes the ordinary success
receipt. Never reconcile console screenshots, copied URLs, writable JSON, or
ambiguous release lists.

## 4. Authorize and onboard an iOS device

The tester performs Firebase acceptance, device-profile installation,
Tailscale setup, application installation, sign-in, and acceptance testing by
following the [shared onboarding guide](SELF_HOSTED_TESTER_ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md).
The operator owns the Apple authorization and rebuilt-IPA loop below. Do not
substitute a Mac identifier, simulator identifier, copied value, or
screen-provided placeholder for a real tester iPhone or iPad.

### 4.1 Collect and verify the real device registration

After the tester completes the guide's Firebase registration step on the real
device, receive the new identifier through the Firebase alert or export it
privately from **App Distribution > Testers & Groups > All testers > Export
Apple UDIDs**. Before using it:

- verify the tester and physical device through a private channel;
- confirm the registration is new and belongs to that tester;
- keep the registration profile, export, device name, and identifier outside
  Git, release notes, screenshots, public chat, and issue trackers; and
- check the Apple annual device allowance before consuming a slot.

The Firebase profile collects the device identifier and installs the App
Distribution web clip. It does not authorize the application by itself.

### 4.2 Register the device with Apple

In Apple **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles > Devices**, register the
verified iPhone or iPad using its private name and identifier. Avoid duplicate
or stale device entries. Apple limits registrations per product family and
membership year; disabling a device during the year does not recover its slot.

### 4.3 Refresh the Ad Hoc profile and publish

In Apple **Profiles**, select the manual Ad Hoc profile for the self-hosted App
ID, choose **Edit**, retain the intended distribution certificate, include the
new device plus every still-authorized device, generate the profile, and
download it to a private path outside Git.

Update these local inputs:

```sh
export ENTE_IOS_ADHOC_PROFILE="/absolute/private/path/refreshed.mobileprovision"
export ENTE_IOS_EXPECTED_DEVICE_COUNT="the-exact-positive-count"
export ENTE_IOS_BUILD_NUMBER="a-higher-positive-build-number"
```

Firebase permits a device-only profile refresh without changing the app build,
but this repository's guarded ledger is intentionally stricter: every later
publication must increase `CFBundleVersion`. Prepare, preflight, and publish
the refreshed release through section 3. Never manually re-sign or upload the
earlier IPA because its embedded profile does not contain the new device.

### 4.4 Complete the private handoff and acceptance

Grant only the required Tailscale host share or membership, create or approve
an individual Museum account according to server policy, and privately send
the refreshed Firebase release plus the exact Museum origin. Do not enable a
public Tailscale Funnel for this beta.

Ask the tester to resume the shared guide and report its `/ping`, install,
Developer Mode, sign-in, upload/download, force-quit, and persistence results.
This application has no Firebase App Distribution runtime SDK, so later builds
arrive through Firebase email and the web clip rather than an in-app prompt.
Use section 7 for failures and request only the minimum redacted diagnostics
described in the tester guide.

## 5. First installation and later updates

### Bundle-identifier cutover for the owner

The legacy bundle `com.vanton1.ente.photos.selfhosted` and the Firebase bundle
`me.vanton.ente.photos.selfhosted` are unrelated iOS applications. Local
preferences, databases, keychain state, cached keys, server binding, and
sessions do not migrate.

Keep both installed while proving the Firebase application. Before deleting
the legacy application:

1. Confirm all intended media is backed up to Museum and can be downloaded.
2. Confirm the Firebase-installed application passed the shared tester guide's
   acceptance test and survived a force-quit/restart.
3. Confirm the account password, second-factor method, and recovery material
   are available outside the iPhone.
4. Accept that deleting the legacy application discards its app-local state.

Then remove only the legacy bundle. Encrypted cloud media remains associated
with the Museum account rather than the iOS bundle identifier.

### In-place Firebase updates

Every update must keep all of these stable:

- bundle `me.vanton.ente.photos.selfhosted`;
- Apple organization team and App ID;
- the reviewed signing/profile policy and currently authorized device set; and
- the intended private-server policy.

The `CFBundleVersion` must increase. Prepare and publish through section 3;
never upload a manually rebuilt IPA. The tester opens the new Firebase build
and installs it over the existing application without deleting it. Afterward,
verify the account, server binding, cloud library, and media remain intact,
then repeat one controlled upload/download and force-restart test.

## 6. Remove a tester

Offboarding is complete only after delivery, future device authorization,
network access, and server access are handled.

1. In Firebase **Testers & Groups**, remove the person from
   `trusted-ios-testers`. Check for access through another group or individual
   release assignment.
2. If the person no longer needs any project release, remove the tester from
   the Firebase project as well.
3. Exclude their iPhone from the next Ad Hoc provisioning profile. Disable the
   Apple device only when appropriate for the organization's device policy;
   disabling it during the membership year does not recover the device slot.
4. Revoke the Tailscale machine share or remove/suspend the tailnet Member and
   their devices according to the existing tailnet policy.
5. Disable or remove the person's Museum account according to the server's
   account-retention policy. Do not delete encrypted server data without a
   separate explicit decision.
6. Record completion only in the private administrative system, not this
   repository.

CLI equivalents for the Firebase steps are:

```sh
"$FIREBASE_CLI" appdistribution:testers:remove "<tester-email>" \
  --group-alias trusted-ios-testers \
  --project "$ENTE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID"

"$FIREBASE_CLI" appdistribution:testers:remove "<tester-email>" \
  --project "$ENTE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID"
```

An already installed IPA can continue running while its signing authorization
remains valid. Firebase and a refreshed future profile are delivery controls,
not remote kill switches; private-server access must be revoked separately.

## 7. Recovery procedures

| Problem | Required response |
|---|---|
| Prepared IPA or manifest changed | Stop. Discard the pair and prepare again from clean pushed source. Do not make it writable or repair it. |
| Wrong Firebase app, bundle, or group | Stop before confirmation. Correct the local inputs or registration; never upload to see whether Firebase accepts it. |
| Firebase failure after upload started | Preserve the partial-attempt receipt and inspect Firebase before any retry. For exit-`0` JSON-only success, capture the official read-only release-list response and use guarded no-upload reconciliation; never upload the same release again. |
| Invitation expired or was accepted with the wrong Google account | Remove stale tester access if necessary, resend the invitation, and privately confirm the intended Google identity before device registration. |
| Tester sees “device registered” but cannot download | Add the collected device to Apple, refresh the Ad Hoc profile, increase the build number, prepare, and publish the new IPA. |
| “Unable to Install” or integrity/profile error | Confirm the exact iPhone is enabled in Apple and embedded in the IPA's unexpired profile; then rebuild through the guarded path. Do not manually re-sign the IPA. |
| “Developer Mode Required” | Enable Developer Mode under iOS Privacy & Security, restart, unlock, and confirm with the device passcode. |
| Firebase release expired | Prepare the known-good source with a higher build number and publish it through the guarded path. Do not bypass the receipt ledger by reusing the old build number. |
| Bad application release | Select the last known-good public commit, increase its build number, prepare and publish it as a forward rollback, then repeat device acceptance. |
| Provisioning profile expired or is near expiry | Regenerate the same Ad Hoc profile with the intended certificate/devices, increase the build number, and publish a fresh guarded build before acceptance testing. |
| Distribution certificate private key is lost | Stop publishing with the missing identity. While authorized Apple organization access remains, issue a replacement distribution certificate, generate a new profile, update the reviewed certificate pin in source, and publish a higher-build recovery release. |
| Distribution certificate is compromised | Revoke it through Apple, which invalidates profiles containing it; issue a replacement, regenerate the profile, update the reviewed pin, and distribute a higher-build replacement. Review Apple and Firebase access separately. |
| Apple membership, agreement, or team access lapses | Restore the organization membership/agreement/authorized role before generating certificates or profiles. Firebase access alone cannot repair Apple authorization. |
| Museum or object storage is unavailable | Restore containers, proxy, Tailscale, DNS, and object-storage health. Do not publish an unchanged application for a server outage. |
| Tester cannot reach the private host | Check Tailscale VPN state, accepted share/membership, approval state, full `*.ts.net` name, and access rules before changing the application. |
| Tester chose the wrong server | Complete local logout, select and validate the correct server through Server Settings, then sign in to the correct Museum account. |
| Firebase operator account is compromised | Revoke the Firebase CLI session, rotate affected credentials, review project membership/releases/testers, and reauthenticate. Do not print login JSON while investigating. |

The current local signing policy does not export the distribution private key
for off-machine backup. Unlike an Android package-key loss, an authorized Apple
organization can recover by issuing a new Apple Distribution certificate under
the same team and App ID. That recovery still requires a new profile, a
reviewed source change to the certificate pin, a higher build number, and full
acceptance testing.

If a valid Ad Hoc application fails only on a highly restricted network, also
check whether Apple's provisioning-profile quality service is reachable. Some
Apple teams require development- and Ad-Hoc-signed applications to contact
`https://ppq.apple.com` when first launched.

## 8. Retention and primary references

These external rules were reverified on 2026-07-20 and can change:

- Firebase tester invitations expire after 30 days if unaccepted; the console
  warns shortly before expiry and can resend them.
- Firebase App Distribution releases are retained for 150 days and are also
  subject to a 1,000-release-per-app limit. Installed copies continue running
  after a release disappears from Firebase, subject to Apple signing and
  profile validity.
- For an Ad Hoc release, Firebase collects the tester iPhone identifier through
  its configuration profile; Apple registration and a rebuilt IPA containing
  that device are still required.
- An Apple Developer Program team can register only a limited number of devices
  per product family in each membership year. Disabling a device during the
  year does not restore a slot.
- Ad Hoc applications on iOS 16 or later require Developer Mode to launch.
- Unused Tailscale user invitations expire after 30 days. A machine share is
  suitable for a fixed host; full tailnet membership is needed for broader
  resources such as subnet-router access.
