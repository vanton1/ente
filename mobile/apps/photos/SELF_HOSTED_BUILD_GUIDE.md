# Locked Self-Hosted Mobile Build Guide

This guide builds the personal Ente Photos Android and iOS applications for
exactly one self-hosted Museum HTTPS origin. The endpoint is compiled into each
application and cannot be changed at runtime.

The personal applications use separate identities from the official Ente app:

- Android release package: `com.vanton1.ente.photos.selfhosted`
- Android debug package: `com.vanton1.ente.photos.selfhosted.debug`
- iOS bundle identifier: `com.vanton1.ente.photos.selfhosted`

The official applications can remain installed alongside these builds.

## 1. Endpoint requirements

Use the Museum origin, without an API path:

```sh
export ENTE_SELF_HOSTED_ENDPOINT="https://photos.example.com"
```

The value must:

- Use HTTPS.
- Contain only a scheme, hostname, and optional port.
- Not contain credentials, a path, query, or fragment.
- Not be an official Ente production API hostname.
- Be reachable and TLS-trusted from the Android or iOS device.

Validate it without building:

```sh
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/mobile/apps/photos"
./scripts/build_self_hosted_android.sh --validate-only
./scripts/build_self_hosted_ios.sh --validate-only
```

## 2. Toolchain on this Mac

The project and CI use Flutter 3.38.10. This checkout currently uses the
following isolated tools:

```sh
export FLUTTER_BIN="/private/tmp/ente-flutter-3.38.10/bin/flutter"
export DART_BIN="/private/tmp/ente-flutter-3.38.10/bin/dart"

export JAVA_HOME="/Users/vanton/projects/ente-android-toolchain/jdk-17.0.19+10/Contents/Home"
export ANDROID_HOME="/Users/vanton/projects/ente-android-toolchain/android-sdk"
export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT="$ANDROID_HOME"

export PATH="/Users/vanton/.cargo/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$(dirname "$FLUTTER_BIN"):/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin"
```

`/private/tmp` may be cleared after a reboot. Restore the pinned Flutter
checkout or change `FLUTTER_BIN` and `DART_BIN` if those paths no longer exist.

From the repository root, install the locked Flutter dependencies when needed:

```sh
cd mobile
"$FLUTTER_BIN" pub get --enforce-lockfile
cd apps/photos
```

Put rustup's `cargo` and `rustc` before incompatible Homebrew installations on
`PATH`, as shown above.

## 3. Android builds

Run Android commands from the Photos application directory:

```sh
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/mobile/apps/photos"
export ENTE_SELF_HOSTED_ENDPOINT="https://photos.example.com"
```

### Debug APK

```sh
./scripts/build_self_hosted_android.sh --debug
```

Output:

```text
build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-selfhosted-debug.apk
```

Install it on a connected emulator or USB-debugging device:

```sh
adb install -r -t build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-selfhosted-debug.apk
```

### Signed release APK

The personal signing material on this Mac is stored outside Git:

```text
/Users/vanton/projects/ente-android-toolchain/signing/ente-photos-selfhosted-release.jks
```

The ignored `android/key.properties` file contains only the keystore path and
alias. The generated password is stored in the macOS login Keychain under the
service `ente-photos-selfhosted-release`.

Load the password into Gradle's existing signing variables, build, and remove
the variables from the current shell:

```sh
SIGNING_PASSWORD="$(security find-generic-password -w -s ente-photos-selfhosted-release)"
export SIGNING_STORE_PASSWORD="$SIGNING_PASSWORD"
export SIGNING_KEY_PASSWORD="$SIGNING_PASSWORD"

./scripts/build_self_hosted_android.sh --release

unset SIGNING_PASSWORD SIGNING_STORE_PASSWORD SIGNING_KEY_PASSWORD
```

Do not add `--no-pub` to the final release build. Flutter must regenerate its
release-only plugin registrant so development plugins are excluded correctly.

Output:

```text
build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-selfhosted-release.apk
```

Install it on a connected USB-debugging device:

```sh
adb install -r build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-selfhosted-release.apk
```

The audited release artifact built for the current local endpoint is also
preserved at:

```text
/Users/vanton/projects/ente-android-toolchain/artifacts/ente-photos-selfhosted-1.3.59-release.apk
```

Its SHA-256 is:

```text
2f5f6011035e396f7b1d3660fe7043fc509115554dcca2051e3fe5a868461fc8
```

### Optional Android artifact checks

```sh
APK="build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-selfhosted-release.apk"
BUILD_TOOLS="$ANDROID_HOME/build-tools/36.0.0"

"$BUILD_TOOLS/aapt2" dump badging "$APK"
"$BUILD_TOOLS/apksigner" verify --verbose --print-certs "$APK"
unzip -t "$APK"
shasum -a 256 "$APK"
```

The current personal signing certificate SHA-256 fingerprint is:

```text
9f0a5f39668e7098d097745931bcb8fc392d50da877cf349a2b20e2db1a4ce69
```

Keep the keystore and its Keychain password safe. Future APK updates for the
same package must be signed by the same key.

## 4. iOS builds

Run iOS commands from the Photos application directory:

```sh
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/mobile/apps/photos"
export ENTE_SELF_HOSTED_ENDPOINT="https://photos.example.com"
```

### iOS Simulator

The simulator build uses ad hoc signing and does not need an Apple development
team:

```sh
./scripts/build_self_hosted_ios.sh --simulator --debug
```

Output:

```text
build/ios/Debug-selfhosted-iphonesimulator/SelfHostedRunner.app
```

Install and launch it on the booted simulator:

```sh
xcrun simctl install booted \
  build/ios/Debug-selfhosted-iphonesimulator/SelfHostedRunner.app
xcrun simctl launch booted com.vanton1.ente.photos.selfhosted
```

### Signed physical-iPhone build

First sign in to an Apple ID in Xcode and make sure an Apple Development
certificate is available. Find the phone identifier with:

```sh
xcrun xcdevice list
```

Then build for the phone:

```sh
export ENTE_IOS_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM="YOUR_TEAM_ID"
export ENTE_IOS_DEVICE_ID="YOUR_CONNECTED_IPHONE_ID"

./scripts/build_self_hosted_ios.sh --debug
```

`ENTE_IOS_DEVICE_ID` is optional after Xcode has registered the phone, but it
helps automatic signing register and provision a newly connected device.

Debug device output:

```text
build/ios/Debug-selfhosted-iphoneos/SelfHostedRunner.app
```

For a signed release device build:

```sh
./scripts/build_self_hosted_ios.sh --release
```

Release device output:

```text
build/ios/Release-selfhosted-iphoneos/SelfHostedRunner.app
```

Install the `.app` through Xcode's Devices and Simulators window. With a recent
Xcode, it can also be installed from the command line:

```sh
xcrun devicectl device install app \
  --device "$ENTE_IOS_DEVICE_ID" \
  build/ios/Debug-selfhosted-iphoneos/SelfHostedRunner.app
```

Use `--no-codesign` only when a non-installable device artifact is explicitly
needed for later signing.

## 5. Changing to another server

There is no runtime server selector in these locked builds. To change servers:

1. Set `ENTE_SELF_HOSTED_ENDPOINT` to the new HTTPS origin.
2. Rebuild the relevant Android or iOS application.
3. Remove the existing self-hosted application and its local data.
4. Install the rebuilt application.
5. Register or log in on the new server.

Installing a different-endpoint build over existing app data intentionally
fails with a stored server-binding mismatch before a network client is
created.

For Android, remove the applicable package before installing the new build:

```sh
adb uninstall com.vanton1.ente.photos.selfhosted
# For a debug installation instead:
adb uninstall com.vanton1.ente.photos.selfhosted.debug
```

For an iPhone, choose **Delete App**, not **Offload App**, before installing the
new build. Offloading preserves the application data and therefore preserves
the old endpoint binding.

For the iOS Simulator:

```sh
xcrun simctl uninstall booted com.vanton1.ente.photos.selfhosted
```

Removing an application clears its local account state; it does not delete
media stored on the old server. Back up any local-only data before switching.

## 6. Private-server connectivity

Before debugging the application, verify that the target device can:

- Resolve the Museum hostname.
- Reach the private network or Tailscale tailnet hosting Museum and MinIO.
- Trust the HTTPS certificate.
- Receive signed MinIO upload and download URLs that are reachable from the
  device.

The compiled endpoint locks authenticated Museum traffic. Museum-provided
signed object-storage URLs continue through the separate upload and download
clients.
